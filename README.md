Centers Elements.

Bind the code into your HTML document using ```<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.le0x8.de/css/center">``` or add the import rule ```@import url("https://cdn.le0x8.de/css/center")``` into your CSS.
Use it then by setting the classes to ```c-container``` for container elements and ```c-element``` for the elements that should be centered.
